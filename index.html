<h2>Why I Made This Website</h2>
<p>I noticed that the minute I got home I would go strait to my couch and scroll for 2 hours for the most. I had so many things I wanted to do like my homework and other things. 
But then my brain said, lets do this later. So I created ConnectED so teens can find things that bring people together with a safe environment around them.</p>
<br>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Many people dont know whats going on around them, where to hang out, what events are happening, or how to get involved locally.
Even thought there are places all over the place where you can do things, it was really hard to find all this information all in onr place.</p>
<br>
<h2>My Goal</h2>
<p>My goal is to chelp kids and adults feel more connected to people in their communtity by giving them a website where they can find info, places, and activities. </p>
