<h2>Why I Made This Website</h2>
<br>
<p>I noticed that the minute I got home I would go strait to my couch and scroll for 2 hours for the most. I had so many things I wanted to do like my homework and other things. But then my brain said, lets do this later. So I created ConnectED so teens can find things that bring people together with a safe environment around them.</p>
