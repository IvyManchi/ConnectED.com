   <h2>Why I Made This Website</h2>
   
   <p>In my freetime, I would always get bored, and was not interested in doing the usual 
    stuff like homework etc and wanted to do something that was exciting and to stay away from screens. So I created 
    ConnectED so teens can find things that bring people together with a safe environment
    around them.

<h2>The Problem</h2>
   <p>Many people dont know whats going on around them, where to hang out, 
    what events are happening, or how to get involved locally.
    Even thought there are places all over the place where you can do things, 
    it was really hard to find all this information all in one place.
   </p>

<h2>My Goal</h2>
   <p>My goal is to chelp kids and adults feel more connected to people in their 
    communtity by giving them a website where they can find info, places, and 
    activities.
